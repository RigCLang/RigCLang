## RigC Compiler

This crate delivers an executable (`rigcc`) that is responsible for the compilation
process of programs written in RigC.

### Usage

The most basic usage is to take an input file (e.g. `input.rigc`):

```sh
rigcc input.rigc
```

the compiler will then generate an output C file: `out.c`.
